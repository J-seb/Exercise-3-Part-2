        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>The Dough</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1kg of flour (this flour can be a mix of different cereals)</li>
            <li>650ml of water</li>
            <li>3 tablespoon of cooking oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of salt</li>
            <li>10gr of yeast</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Pizza</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>300 ml of tomato pulp</li>
            <li>0.5kg of Mozzarella</li>
            <li>Another ingredient you like</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <p>First you have to do the dough, mix in a bowl the flour with the salt and the yeast with a spoon. Then
            incorporate slowly a half of the water and mix it. Later put the other half into the bowl and repeat the
            mix. When all ingredients are incorporate, you must to start to knead the dough with your hands. Add the
            cooking oil to the dough and continue the process of knead.</p>

        <p>Finally put the dough inside the bowl, close it, and let it rest for 2 hours, this is necesary because you
            need the dough get brew</p>

        <p>Meanwhile you can prepare the other ingredients, you can do a mix of different ingredients like ground beef,
            chicken, mushrooms, salami, pineapple (I really don't recommend it), etc. And preheat the oven</p>

        <p>When the dough is ready you can see it grown. cut the dough in some pieces and extend in a plate, the plate
            previously must have some oil, then add on the dough the tomato pulp, and put it into the oven for 20
            minutes.</p>

        <p>Finally add the other ingredients, mainly the mozzarella, and put the plate into the oven again for 10
            minutes.</p>

        <p>Enjoy it !!!</p>
